            <h2> Interests </h2>
            <p>When I'm not busy honing my front-end development skills, I enjoy exploring other passions that bring color and joy to my life. As an art enthusiast, I love expressing myself through different mediums, while DIY projects offer me the chance to get creative and solve problems. Whether I'm cruising on my bike or diving into a new art project, I find that these interests keep me inspired, fulfilled, and always seeking out new challenges.</p>
